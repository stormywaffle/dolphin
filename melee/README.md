## These files are made to work with Super Smash Bros. Melee version NTSC 1.02 in Dolphin. 

For directions on how to use these codes you can look at https://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/wiki/HowTo_Add_your_own_codes

Please Note:

* I did not write all of these codes (But I did write a good amount). This repository just contains the AR/Gecko codes that I used with my version of dolphin along with some of the ASM that would later be converted into my codes.

* If you want to learn write your own dolphin codes I recommend you try reading http://smashboards.com/threads/assembly-guides-resources-q-a.397941/ to get started.

**This is NOT related to the 20xx hack pack.**  The hack pack was made by various collaborators in the smash community. Although I did discover/create codes for lower case letters in Melee and some of those codes served as a basis for codes in the hack pack (Which you can see here).
